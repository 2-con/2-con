# 2 CON
Hi!

Im a self-taught Artificial Intellegence and Machine Learning Student who specializes in backend development. So from neural networks and Bayesean statistics, im trying to get a good understanding of the field. But aside from AI/ML, i also dabble in data engineering and data science as a hobby from time to time.

I mainly program in Python and a fair bit of experience in Java.
